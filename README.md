Given a sufficiently well-behaved closed curve in the plane it's possible to prove that one can assemble a system of orbiting planets, each orbiting the previous planet in the sequence in a circle, such that the motion of the final planet precisely traces out the given curve. In a single sentence, the proof is this: the final orbit, viewed as a path in the complex plane, is a sum of complex exponentials, which is nothing but a Fourier series, but we already know that most "reasonable" curves in the plane can be represented in such a form; each coefficient of the Fourier series can be computed as an integral using standard techniques of Fourier analysis, and this integral can be approximated when given a finite set of sample points on the original curve.

When running this, start clicking around the screen to place points and watch the orbiting planetary system be automatically constructed in real-time.
